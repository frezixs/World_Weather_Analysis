# World_Weather_Analysis
generate random Longitute and Latitude, the use this to find the nearest cities and hotels, analysis the weather in these cities, 
pick those cities with suitable weather for the customers, then mark hotels around each cities that the traveller can live. 
Also, given 4 cities, I gave a shortest way to drive through. 

## A Brief Summary of My work 
In this chanllenge we basically repeat what we did in the module, that is make API calls, generate random Longitute and Latitude 
and drawing heatmap and mark the map. But I'm glad to learn something new, for example we learned how to draw routes by ourselves 
which is not in the module, we learned it directly from the documentation, which is a good practice, also the concat method looks 
interesting and it may have furthur usage in the future. Another good thing is I got more and more used to the loc method, this 
method is so powerful and it must be used a lot in work. 
Generally I feel that I have a better understanding of python throughout this 4 weeks of studies.
